Pre-condition:

User is already logged into the application and is on the Billing Dashboard.

Document Tags widget is visible and contains tags with varied counts (0, <10, >10).

If tag count = 0, “No data available” text should be shown. [ER: 7]

If tag count > 0 and ≤ 10:
  - No pagination should be visible.
  - Row count should match the actual count. [ER: 8]

  - Prev arrow should be disabled.
  - Click Next, 2nd page should load.
  - Click Prev, page 1 should reappear. [ER: 10]
  - On last page, Next arrow should be disabled.
  - Total pages should be LP = (count // 10) + (1 if count % 10 > 0 else 0). [ER: 11]

Click on the first Load number (if count > 0). [ER: 12]

User should be redirected to Load Details Page of selected load. [ER: 13]
